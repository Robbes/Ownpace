# Workplan 0084 — a gate for the edition nobody tests

## Status — 2026-08-18 (update this block at the end of every session)

**Nothing here is built.** This is a plan, written 2026-08-18 at the owner's
request. Every row is ⬜ until somebody does it.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| T1 stand the managed stack up in CI | ⬜ **Planned** | `deploy/compose/managed.yml` is **fourteen services**: postgres, pgbouncer, trigger-db, trigger-redis, trigger-api, clickhouse, trigger-registry, trigger-docker-proxy, trigger-supervisor, minio, trigger-tls, api, web, nextcloud. That is the honest scope — this is not "add a job". Self-hosted arm64 Spark runner, same as `e2e.yml`, because nothing else in CI can host it. |
| T2 the acceptance itself — **mostly already written** | ⬜ **Planned** | `deploy/compose/smoke-managed.sh` (257 lines, workplan 0020 T5) already drives the live verify + apply smoke against a running managed stack, captures runner logs before AutoRemove destroys them, and lands stuck rows by hand rather than leaving them pointing at nothing. **This task is wiring, not writing.** `setup-managed-demo.sh` + `seed-managed.ts` + `deploy-tasks.sh` are the bring-up it expects. |
| T3 the pooler is in the path | ⬜ **Planned** | The reason this workplan exists at all. 0082 T4 shipped PgBouncer and **nothing can verify it** — `e2e.yml` stands up `deploy/selfhost/compose.yml` and never references `managed.yml`. The gate must assert the app is actually talking through the pooler (`SHOW POOLS` reports non-zero `cl_active`) and that **migrations are not** (they hold a session advisory lock; through a transaction pooler two replicas would stop excluding each other, silently). Closing 0082 T4 is this task. |
| T4 nightly, and somebody reads it | ⬜ **Planned** | Nightly like `e2e.yml` (`30 1` postgres, `30 3` pglite — pick a third slot, not one of those two: the Spark cannot run them concurrently). **A nightly nobody reads is worse than no nightly**, because it converts a real signal into a green-looking habit. See "Who reads it" below. |
| T5 evidence without leaking secrets | ⬜ **Planned** | `smoke-managed.sh` already warns that runner debug logs print the **full task environment — `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, the `tr_prod_` key**. A nightly job that uploads those as an artifact is a credential disclosure with a retention policy. Redaction is a prerequisite for artifact upload, not a nicety. |
| T6 teardown that actually tears down | ⬜ **Planned** | Fourteen services, named volumes, a local registry and a docker proxy on a **shared, long-lived** machine. `e2e.yml` already learned this (`down -v --remove-orphans` before and after). A nightly that leaks volumes fills the Spark's disk in weeks, and the failure will look like something else entirely. |
| T7 what "green" is allowed to mean | ⬜ **Planned** | Stated up front so the gate cannot quietly weaken. See below. |

## What this is

The owner asked for a managed end-to-end gate, nightly, with the results
checked. It follows directly from a finding recorded the same day (0083): **the
managed edition has no end-to-end gate at all.** The unit and integration tiers
cover managed *code*; nothing stands the managed *stack* up. That is why
PgBouncer could not be verified by CI and why the honest answer to "is the
pooler tested?" was "no, and it cannot be".

The good news, found while scoping this: most of the acceptance already exists.
0020 T5 wrote `smoke-managed.sh` precisely because *"a green CI says nothing
about whether an enqueue actually becomes a runner on this machine"* — which is
the same sentence this workplan would otherwise have had to write from scratch.

## What "green" is allowed to mean (T7)

A gate is only as honest as its weakest allowed pass. Stated before it is built:

1. **The stack came up** — every service healthy, not merely started.
2. **A task deployed and RAN** — an enqueue became a runner container on this
   machine. This is 0018 T5's lesson and the reason the smoke exists.
3. **Verify reached a terminal state**, and `apply` reached `applied` **or**
   `refused`. A refusal is a legitimate pass: the gates said no and said why.
4. **The app talked through PgBouncer, and migrations did not** (T3).
5. **The teardown left nothing behind.**

And what must NOT count as green: a skipped step, a timed-out poll, or a stack
that came up with a service in `unhealthy` while nothing asserted on it.

## Who reads it, and what happens on red (T4)

The owner asked for results "checked by you". Concretely:

- A scheduled check-in reads the nightly run each morning, the same mechanism
  already used to watch PRs to green.
- **Red on the managed gate is diagnosed, not re-run.** A re-run is the correct
  fix only when the job died before anything of its own ran — lost runner,
  registry pull, disk. Anything else gets root-caused, because on a stack this
  size "flaky" is where real defects go to hide.
- Two consecutive reds, or any red that is not understood within a day, is
  raised to the owner rather than sat on.

**The failure mode to design against is not a red nightly. It is a nightly that
goes red and stays red** until everyone reads the badge as decoration.

## Cost, stated rather than discovered

Fourteen services on one shared arm64 machine, nightly, alongside two existing
e2e runs. Before building: measure a manual `up → smoke → down` cycle and write
the number here. If it exceeds roughly 30 minutes, the honest options are a
narrower gate (bring up fewer services and say which are unproven) or a lower
frequency — **not** a gate that quietly overruns and gets cancelled by the next
one, which reads as green while proving nothing.

## What this deliberately does NOT do

- **No real O365 source.** Same posture as `e2e.yml`: Stalwart and Nextcloud
  are the fixtures. A gate that needs live Microsoft credentials is a gate that
  fails for reasons that are not ours.
- **No public-internet exposure.** The stack comes up on the Spark's network
  and dies there.
- **Not a performance test.** It proves the stack works, not that it is fast.
  0082's numbers still want `pg_stat_statements`, which is a separate thing.
